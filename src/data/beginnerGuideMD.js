## Getting started

Have you ever found yourself thinking "I exercise, so I can eat anything I want" or "I eat healthy, so I don't need to exercise?" 
That train of thought is what causes unexpected weight gain and unhealthy habits.
\n
**Exercise** and a **healthy diet** go hand in hand when it comes to attaining any fitness goals.

  &nbsp;

## Why Exercise?

Regular exercise has been shown to improve your health **significantly**. Singapore’s Health Promotion Board recommends a minimum of 
**150 minutes** of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week. Exercising can help:

1. Reduce the risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers

2. Strengthen bones, muscles, and joints

3. Improve balance and coordination

4. Reduce stress and anxiety for overall mental well-being

5. Maintain a healthy weight to help you look and feel good

## Types of Exercises

There are many different types of exercises that you can do. Listed below are some of the most common types:

## Starting a Workout Plan

1. **Know your baseline fitness level:** If you have been mostly sedentary, it is good to **start slowly** and increase your activity level over time. 
   This allows your body to get used to more strenuous activities down the line while being less vulnerable to injuries.

2. **Identify your goals:** It is good at the start to **know what you are exercising for**. Having a goal to have six-pecs will lead to a different 
   fitness journey as compared to if your goal is to simply lose weight.

3. **Availability of equipment:** You can work with any equipment you currently have **without** having to purchase additional ones. 
   You should not feel that you are restricted from exercising due to a lack of equipment. While having more equipment definitely 
   allows a greater variety of exercises, body weight exercises alone are **sufficient**.

4. **Choose your exercises:** When starting out, it might seem daunting at the sheer number of possible exercises to do. 
   One good way to choose will be to **try out various exercises** and keep the ones that feel comfortable to do. 
   Ideally you should aim for a workout plan that covers **most** of the main body parts.

5. **How many reps and sets should you do?** Ideally you should aim for about **3 to 5 sets** of each exercise. For each set, 
   the number of reps depends on many factors such as your fitness goal, the type of exercise and your fitness level. 
   It is best to start at a weight where you can comfortably perform 10 reps with proper form.

6. **How often to exercise:** Most experts recommend exercising a **minimum of 3 times a week**. Moreover, you should rest a particular muscle 
   group 2 days after exercising that same muscle group.

7. **Make it a habit:** After figuring out all the details of your workout plan. It is important to set aside **exclusive workout time** a few days each week. 
   This helps you stay on track and keeps you focused on your workout.

8. **Keep track of your progress:** Lastly, keeping a journal or using apps like MyFitnessPal to **keep track** of the weight and reps that you do for each 
   session allows you to record your own progress and makes it easier to modify your workout plan at any time.

9. **Following up:** After each workout session, you should **reflect** on your workout session and **identify changes** for the subsequent session. 
   You can choose to increase the weight or the rep counts for each subsequent session. 
   On the other hand, if you feel an unusual ache or strain after a particular exercise, you might consider lowering the weight or rep count or switching out that exercise.

## Some Common Terminology

*   **Rep (repetition):** A single instance of an exercise like a dumbbell bicep curl.

*   **Set:** A group of repetitions performed sequentially, like 3 sets of 10 reps of bicep curls.

*   **Super-set:** doing 2 or more exercises without rest periods in between them. (e.g.: bench set—no rest—dumbbell curl set).

*   **Compound exercises:** exercises that work multiple muscle groups at the same time. (e.g. squats is a compound exercise that works the quadriceps, glutes, and calves.
    
*   **Isolation exercises:** exercises that work only one muscle group. (e.g. bicep curls is an isolation exercise that works the biceps).

*   **Form:** a specific way of performing a movement, often a strength training exercise, to avoid injury and increase strength.

*   **Negatives:** a variation to specific exercises. (e.g. a negative pull up is to start at the top, and slowly lower yourself in a controlled manner).

*   **Macros:** Short for macronutrients: protein, carbohydrates and fats.

*   **Supine:** lie down fully flat on the floor facing upwards.

*   **Hypertrophy:** an increase in muscular size achieved through exercise

*   **Progressive overloading:** a continual increase in the total workload by increasing weight or rep count during training sessions that
    will stimulate muscle growth and strength gain.

*   **Working weight:** the weight you use throughout all of your sets and reps.

*   **Metabolism:** the process by which your body converts what you eat and drink into energy.

`,

  `
  &nbsp;

## Workout Tips and Tricks

*   When you first start exercising you’ll experience feelings of **discomfort** such as shortness of breath, sweating and aching muscles after exercising. 
    Don’t worry, this is **completely normal** and everyone feels like this when they’re first starting out.

*   Focus on **consistency rather than intensity**. This helps you progress at a suitable pace while reducing chances of potential injuries.

*   Results come through **regular and consistent activity**. Stick to your programme and avoid frequent stops and starts.

*   On top of routine workout days, it is also good to maintain an **active lifestyle** and be increasingly on the move.

*   Being able to do a set in **proper form** is better than being able to do a higher weight in poor form.

*   Ensure that you do **proper warm ups and cool downs**. A simple way to warmup is to simply perform a few reps of the planned exercise.

*   Have **meals 2 to 3 hours before** exercise to ensure that you have time to digest your food. Alternatively you can opt for a light snack before exercising to fuel your workouts.

*   Ensure that you have **sufficient rest** between each workout day. This allows your muscles to fully recover and allows you to achieve optimal performance during the workout.

## Importance Of A Healthy Diet

Before starting any nutrition plan, you first have to learn what calories are and why they have the **biggest role** in your nutrition. 
A calorie (kcal) is a unit of energy, which is found within the foods and drinks we consume every day. 
These calories help you get energy throughout the day, so you can perform your daily tasks. Moreover, eating the **right amount** of calories 
is necessary in fitness if you want to achieve your goals.

Everyone has a different **basal metabolic rate (BMR)**, which is the estimation of how many calories your body will burn at rest. 
Eating food will increase your caloric intake, whereas exercising burns calories. To attain your fitness goals, 
a simple method is to consume more calories if your goal is to gain muscle, and to lower your caloric intake if you plan to lose weight

  `
  &nbsp;

## The Three Macronutrients

![The Three Macronutrients](https://i.imgur.com/Y0gDyu9.png#chart)

However, not all calories are equal, it can come in the form of **3 macronutrients - carbohydrates, fats or proteins**. 
In general, most of the food you consume has a combination of the 3 macronutrients. Ideally you should break down your caloric intake according to the following guidelines:

*   45–65% of their calories from carbs
*   20–35% of their calories from fats
*   10–35% of their calories from proteins 




`,

  `
  &nbsp;

## Tips For Better Nutrition

1. **Find out how many calories you need each day:** Use calorie calculators to find out your **BMR**.

2. **Keep track of your eating:** Keep a food diary or an app like MyFitnessPal to track your meals and calories.
   This will give you **crucial information** to help you figure out changes you might need to make.

3. **Make small changes:** Experts claim that we do a much better job of making permanent changes when we keep them **small and reasonable**. 
   For example, if you usually skip breakfast, make it your goal to eat something each morning, even if it's just a glass of orange juice or some yogurt. 
   Skipping breakfast can actually slow your metabolism, which can hurt your weight loss goals.

4. **Add rather than subtract:** If you don't know where to start, **add something healthy** to your diet instead of taking something away. 
   For example, drink a glass of water before a meal or add an extra source of protein to your next meal.

5. **Stay hydrated:** Often, a feeling of hunger is actually your body telling you it's **thirsty**.

6. **Eat more fiber:** Fiber fills your belly and helps you feel full so you naturally eat less. 
   It's also much easier to **add healthy foods to your diet** than it is to add more restrictions, 
   which only makes you crave the very foods you're trying to stay away from.

7. **Snack Often:** If you're starving, eat a healthy snack such as fruits, nuts and yoghurt. When you wait too long,
   you may end up **overeating** during meal times to satisfy that gnawing hunger.

8. **Prep for the week:** One of the easiest ways to avoid the fast food trap is having **healthy meals** available.

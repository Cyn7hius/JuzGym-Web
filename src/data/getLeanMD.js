## What is Muscle Tone?

Muscle tone refers to how **lean** we are and how **defined** our muscles appear. Other common terms include getting lean and getting **shredded**. 
Toning up is a common goal for many. It involves a **delicate balance** of muscle building while not gaining unnecessary fats. 
This can be done by performing **resistance exercise** on top of having a healthy diet in place to achieve a **caloric deficit**.

## Achieving Toned Muscles

There are many different starting points to getting toned muscles. 
You can **start lean and progressively build muscle** while not putting on fats. 
Or you can **start bulky and lose fats** while retaining muscle mass.

For most people, getting toned requires them to build muscle mass or **"bulking"** before focusing on fat loss. 
This allows you to build up the **necessary muscle** underneath your fat layer. 
You can follow our guides on building muscle and losing weight accordingly for more info. 
In this guide, we will provide additional tips and info to achieve the balance of low fats and high muscle mass

## A Possible Shortcut?

However, there are ways to shortcut this process by building muscle and losing weight **concurrently**. 
It is possible to reconfigure your body composition over time, but your weight will change. 
And the process may **take longer** than if you went through the traditional cycling of massing and cutting. 

One study suggests that with **high protein intake** and a **well-planned** strength training program, 
you may be able to increase lean mass while simultaneously losing body fat. 
Researchers found that as long as protein intakes remain high (up to 2g of protein per kg of body weight), 
and you are participating in regular strength training, you may not only be able to preserve lean mass in a calorie deficit but can help increase it slightly. 
Although this approach is likely not efficient long-term, it is **difficult to achieve**, 
and the amount of muscle gained may not be as significant as what you would experience on a traditional bulking diet.

## Supplementing Your Workouts

These tips **complement** your existing workout plan and build upon it. Use these tips to **boost your training effectiveness** 
by helping you burn more fats and get your heart pumping harder.

1. **Focus on big motions:** By engaging a greater number of muscle groups than single-joint movements, 
   multi joint exercises like **compound exercises** allow you to lift far heavier loads, which raises your metabolism both during and after your workout.

2. **Use heavier weights:** While lighter weights allow you to burn more calories, 
   heavier weights helps **boost your metabolism** which will have far greater effect on weight loss overall

3. **Do denser workouts:** By **cutting down on rest times** after each set, you can achieve greater workout density while continuously pushing your body. 
   Doing **supersets** can also further improve weight loss.
   
4. **Do HIIT exercises:** It is a quick way to burn calories effectively. Moreover, it provides a greater **variety** of exercises to make cardio more enjoyable.

5. **Ensure sustainable weight loss:** Drastic weight loss has been shown to have **adverse** health effects. **Do not** restrict calories too much or dehydrate yourself.

## Ensuring Proper Nutrition

As muscle toning involves a caloric deficit, it is also important to ensure that you are **not eating more than necessary**. 
Moreover, it is also imperative that you eat **properly and healthily**. Here are some tips to achieve optimal nutrition.



1. **Hydration:** The only drinks you should consume within a cutting diet are **water, green tea and black coffee**. 
   Other drinks either contain **extra calories** or have artificial sweeteners and other things that can **detract** from your progress. 
   Water is calorie free, keeps you hydrated and is basically all you need to drink. 

2. **Sugars:** One of the best ways to cut is to opt for **low GI** (Glycemic index) foods. Loosely, GI relates to a food’s sugar content and 
   how fast it releases glucose in the body. If you haven’t worked out and eat high GI foods, they are stored as fat. 
   With that in mind, you should cut out sugary, high GI food such as white rice, white bread and pasta and replace them 
   with low GI carbs such as brown basmati rice, wholegrains and fruit such as apples and berries.

3. **Fats:** There are good and bad fats, but in a cutting diet you want to try to reduce your intake of all kinds, 
   since fats are an inefficient energy source compared to carbs and are responsible for the physical appearance of body fat. 
   With that in mind, aim for **20% or less** of your calorie intake from good fats.

4. **Count your calories:** Use a tracker like MyFitnessPal or other apps to keep track of each and every single calorie. 
   In fact, many studies show that recording your food intake and physical activity gives you a more **accurate estimation** of your 
   calorie intake and prevents **under or overestimation** of your caloric intake, thus vastly improving the weight loss process.

5. **Eat more fruits and vegetables:** These provide **invaluable micronutrients** that help improve optimally. 
   Moreover, fruits are a good snack to eat throughout the day as it is calorie light and healthy.

## Frequently Asked Questions:

**Q:** Is there a way to shrink tummy fat fast?

**A:** There is **no such thing as spot fat reduction**, meaning you cannot specifically do abs exercises to lose tummy fat. 
       During exercise, the free fatty acids and glycerol used as fuel can come from fats stored anywhere in the body, 
       not specifically from the area that is being exercised. The only way is to **lose fats overall** through a calorie deficit.

**Q:** How much weight must I lose to achieve the toned look?

**A:** While the exact weight is hard to determine, you should aim for **15-19 body fat % for females and 10-14 body fat % for males**.

**Q:** Should I cut down on carbs?

**A:** Contrary to popular opinion, carbs alone do not cause weight gain. And if you are hitting the gym hard, 
       your workouts could benefit from adequate carb intake. Instead of going low carb, consider **cycling your carbs**.

**Q:** Do I need to do cardio?

**A:** Not necessarily. The more important factor is to have a calorie deficit. Cardio is **simply a way to burn fats** effectively.
       Alternatively you can try HIIT workouts or other workouts that boost your heart rate.

## What is Muscle Tone?

Muscle tone refers to how **lean** we are and how **defined** our muscles appear. Other common terms include getting lean and getting **shredded**. 
It involves a **delicate balance** of muscle building while not gaining unnecessary fats. 
This can be done by performing **resistance exercise** on top of having a healthy diet in place to achieve a **caloric deficit**.

## Achieving Toned Muscles

There are many different starting points to getting toned muscles. 
You can **start lean and progressively build muscle** while not putting on fats. 
Or you can **start bulky and lose fats** while retaining muscle mass.

For most people, getting toned requires them to build muscle mass or **"bulking"** before focusing on fat loss. 
This allows you to build up the **necessary muscle** underneath your fat layer. 
You can follow our guides on building muscle and losing weight accordingly for more info. 
In this guide, we will provide additional tips and info to achieve the balance of low fats and high muscle mass

## A Possible Shortcut?

However, there are ways to shortcut this process by building muscle and losing weight **concurrently**. 
It is possible to reconfigure your body composition over time, but your weight will change. 
And the process may **take longer** than if you went through the traditional cycling of massing and cutting. 

One study suggests that with **high protein intake** and a **well-planned** strength training program, 
you may be able to increase lean mass while simultaneously losing body fat. 
Researchers found that as long as protein intakes remain high (up to 2g of protein per kg of body weight), 
and you are participating in regular strength training, you may not only be able to preserve lean mass in a calorie deficit but can help increase it slightly. 
Although this approach is likely not efficient long-term, it is **difficult to achieve**, 
and the amount of muscle gained may not be as significant as what you would experience on a traditional bulking diet.

## Frequently Asked Questions:

**Q:** Is there a way to shrink tummy fat fast?

**A:** There is **no such thing as spot fat reduction**, meaning you cannot specifically do abs exercises to lose tummy fat. 
       During exercise, the free fatty acids and glycerol used as fuel can come from fats stored anywhere in the body, 
       not specifically from the area that is being exercised. The only way is to **lose fats overall** through a calorie deficit.

**Q:** How much weight must I lose to achieve the toned look?

**A:** While the exact weight is hard to determine, you should aim for **15-19 body fat % for females and 10-14 body fat % for males**.

**Q:** Should I cut down on carbs?

**A:** Contrary to popular opinion, carbs alone do not cause weight gain. And if you are hitting the gym hard, 
       your workouts could benefit from adequate carb intake. Instead of going low carb, consider **cycling your carbs**.

**Q:** Do I need to do cardio?

**A:** Not necessarily. The more important factor is to have a calorie deficit. Cardio is **simply a way to burn fats** effectively.
       Alternatively you can try HIIT workouts or other workouts that boost your heart rate.

**Q:**

**A:**

## What is Muscle Building?

Muscle growth is primarily about the rate of **protein synthesis** compared to **protein breakdown** within your body. 
Having a **net gain** of protein will lead to muscle growth. 

To build new muscle tissue, your primary tools for increasing your bodyâ€™s rate of protein synthesis are performing **resistance training** and 
getting sufficient amounts of protein and overall nutrients.

When performing resistance training, you are actually causing tiny tears known as **micro-tears** in the muscle fibers, 
which the body then repairs and adapts the muscles to better handle the stimulus that caused the damage. This is the process by which muscles grow.

## The Role of Proper Nutrition

**Protein** provides the building blocks for **muscle growth** and supplies the amino acids needed to reduce muscle breakdown. 
Protein builds new muscle AND saves existing muscle; both functions are necessary for maximizing muscle mass. 
Muscle is made out of protein and is therefore the **most important macronutrient** for body composition purposes. 
It is recommended to intake about 1.5 to 2g of protein per kg of body mass to build muscles.

**Fats** also play a vital role in muscle building, and you **should not skimp on fats**. It is important for a number of essential 
processes in the body that help to make us healthy, for example some of the essential fats found in oily fish, 
e.g. EPA and DHA have been shown to have positive effects on our brain, vision and heart health. 
The dietary reference intake (DRI) for fat in adults is 20% to 35% of total calories from fat.

**Calorie intake** is the amount of energy in the food that we consume. By having sufficient calorie intake, 
it reduces the rate of protein breakdown which in turn increases the rate of muscle growth. 
Majority of calories would come in the form of carbohydrates like grain, rice and sugars. 
However, different types of carbohydrates have different effects on your body and thus it is better to eat 
**less-processed carbohydrates** like wholemeal and cut down on sugary foods.

Consuming a **right balance** of nutrients is vital to keep your body healthy and also boosts muscle recovery and performance. 
To gain muscle, you should aim for a caloric surplus of about 200 to 300kcal a day. 
This can be easily achieved by drinking a cup of milk a day for example, or having nuts or fruits as a healthy snack throughout the day.

## Form and Dealing with Injuries

While exerting so much strength and pressure, it is **not uncommon** to experience some discomfort occasionally. 
This includes **minor discomfort** like pain when you bend your wrist, or even **piercing pain** when during workouts. 

When this happens, it usually means that there is **improper form involved**. This means that you are not doing the exercises properly 
and are exerting pressure on the **wrong areas**, which might harm you in the long run. A good way to check your form is to perform the 
exercise in front of a mirror or ask someone to spot you while doing the exercise.

It is always good to **listen to your body** and understand when your body needs rest, or when you need to adjust your workouts and form. 
If you are unsure if you are doing the exercise correctly, the **safe bet** is always to decrease weights or completely stop doing that exercise. 
Like with everything else, it is vital to train for the **long term**, rather than risk it for short term gains.

    instructions:
      "Assume the starting position for the standing dumbbell curl by grasping a pair of dumbbells and standing straight up, feet together and dumbbells by your side. The dumbbells should not be touching your body.\nYour palms should facing upwards.\nTake up the slack by bending the elbows slightly. Tension should be on the biceps.\nSlowly curl the dumbbells up as far as possible.\nSqueeze the biceps hard, and then slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.\nRepeat for desired reps.",
    safety:
      'The tension should be on the biceps at all times. Do not let them "hang" at the bottom of the exercise.\nKeep the rep timing slow and control the weight throughout the set.\nDo not let the dumbbells touch your body.\nAnd finally, do not swing the body back as you curl up the weight. The body should stay fixed throughout the movement. Focus on only moving your forearms.',

    safety:
      "Ensure that the lower back doesn’t arch as you extend the hip, you should focus on squeezing the glutes and slightly posteriorly tilting the pelvis.\nIdeally you should prioritize a straight line from your knees through your shoulders at the peak of contraction.\nFocus on exhaling as you bridge the hips up. You shouldn’t feel the movement through your lower back at all.\nAs you push out on the band, don’t allow the knees to track out past the outside of your feet.\nIf you can’t seem to feel your glutes activating, palpate the musculature with your hands and focus on pausing the movement at the peak of contraction.",

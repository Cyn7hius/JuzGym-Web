Your eyes should be facing up and your shoulders back. This will prevent your lower back from rounding.\nSqueeze up through the glutes and hamstrings until you're standing straight up.\nRepeat for desired reps.\n",
    tips: "You must keep your eyes looking up at all times. As soon as you look down at the floor your back will round.\nThe dumbbells need to stay close to your body throughout the set. The further the dumbbells are from your body the more strain is on your lower back.\nFocus on stretching the hamstrings out as you lower the dumbbells and contracting them as you raise back up. The greater the mind-muscle connection the more you'll get out of this exercise.\nIt's best to have your knees slightly bent during the set but fixed (ie: bend them slightly but keep them locked in the same place throughout the set).\nDuring the descent, to protect your lower back, keep your weight back on the heels. Do not let your weight shift forward onto the toes. If you find the your weight on the toes when at the bottom position of the exercise, you are performing it incorrectly.\nDo not relax at the bottom of the movement.

Down, not back.\nSome forward translation of the knees over the toes is alright provided that the knees don’t deviate excessively inward or outward.

    tips: 'You should be focusing on stretch and muscle contraction, not using heavy weights.\nRemember to keep your rep timing slow and controlled. So many people use momentum to swing heavy weights up, and this is not going to get you the best results from the dumbbell lateral raise.\nIt very important that your elbows stay above your wrists. If your wrists come up too far, the focus comes off your side delts and onto your front delts.

    instructions:
      "Grasp a dumbbell using a underhand grip (palms facing up) and sit down on a chair\nRest the back of your forearm on top of your inner thigh so that the wrist holding the dumbbell is just off the end of it.\nBending only at the wrist, let the dumbbell drop as far as possible. You can rest your non-working arm in your lap for stability. This is the starting position for the exercise.\nSlowly raise the dumbbell up as far as possible squeezing the forearm muscles at the top of the movement.\nPause, and then slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.\nRepeat for desired reps.\n",
    tips: "A light weight should be used with proper technique. It doesn't take heavy weight to make this exercise effective.\nKeep the rep timing slow, and pause/squeeze the forearms for a count of two at the top of the movement for added intensity.\nUse a full range of motion by allowing the weight to drop as far as possible at the bottom of the movement.\n",

    tips: "When you extend the leg, ensure the movement comes entirely from hip extension and you don’t substitute lumbar extension instead (i.e. when you extend the leg, your back shouldn’t arch, you shouldn’t feel a contraction in your spinal erectors, and the leg should be inline with your torso.)\nSimilarly, as you reach overhead, watch for excessive extensive through the lumbar spine as a compensation.\nAs you reach overhead, you should be able to feel your lower trap (at the bottom edge of your scapula closest to your spine) working somewhat reflexively.\nIf you find you can’t seem to get the hip fully extended or the arm fully overhead, check your core position first (i.e. fix the extension bias). Then, look at a lack of thoracic extension, glute activation, core stability, or scapular upward rotation.\nExhale as you reach and push. Imagine you’re trying to balance a cup of water on your back as you complete reps. The goal is control repetitions, not just the quantity of reps performed.\n\n",

    tips: "To decrease bicep involvement, use a false (thumbless grip).\nTry to keep a neutral head position (looking straight ahead or slightly up) as hyperextending the neck can lead to compensations throughout the spine.\nIf the bar is high enough, keep the legs straight and in front of the body.\nAvoid falling into overextension of the lumbar spine by squeezing your glutes and bracing your abs.\nThe chin up is completed when the lats are fully flexed, don’t continue pulling and compensate with the pecs.\nKeep your shoulders down and back, if they round forward at the top then you’ve pulled too far.\nA lifter’s segment length will determine whether or not they can actually get their chin over the bar, it’s not an absolute for everyone.\nLower to almost full extension of the elbow but avoid locking out completely as this can place excessive strain on the ligamentous structures within the elbow and shoulder.\nIf you can’t complete a single bodyweight chin up, start with slow negatives or flexed arm hangs at the top position.",

    tips: "Toe angle is highly individual - experiment to see what feels best for you.

    tips: "Looking slightly up while shrugging may enhance the contraction as traps help to control movement of the skull. This motion should be smooth and controlled, as a ballistic movement could result in a neck injury.\nThe traps tend to respond well to high reps and explosive movements (e.g. snatch grip high pulls) so program your accessory work accordingly.\nLimit momentum and excessive jerking or bouncing of the weight. No one cares about how much you shrug.\nDon’t allow the head to jut forward excessively as you squeeze the traps, this can put the neck in a compromised position and result in an injury.\nAdding a pause at the top of the movement can help to enhance the mind muscle connection.\n\n",

When this occurs, the elbows will flare up behind the body, the shoulder will round forward, and you’ll begin to feel pressure in the front of your shoulders.\nA lifter’s segment length will determine whether or not they can actually get their chin over the bar, it’s not an absolute for everyone.\nLower to almost full extension of the elbow but avoid locking out completely as this can place excessive strain on the ligamentous structures within the elbow and shoulder.\nIf you can’t complete a single bodyweight pullup, start with slow negatives (add weight when these can be accomplished under control) or flexed arm hangs in the top position.\n\n\n",

Down, not back.\nSome forward translation of the knees over the toes is alright provided that the knees don’t deviate excessively inward or outward.

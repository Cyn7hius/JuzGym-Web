## Calorie Management

Caloric **balance** is the key to managing your weight. You do not have to give up your favourite foods just because they are high in calories.

The recommended daily calorie intake for females on average is about **1600 kcal/day**. An average man needs about **2000 kcal/day**. 
While these numbers do not apply to everyone, it serves as a good **baseline** to follow

When you eat more calories than what your body “burns off”, these **extra calories** will be stored as fat in your body, leading to weight gain. 
If you want to lose weight, the number of calories you consume must be less than the number of calories burned through physical activity.

While calorie intake is the **main factor** to controlling your weight, other factors include your genetics, your **natural metabolism**, 
as well as the contents of the food that you consume. These factors vary in their importance from person to person.

## Watch what you eat

While cutting calories is a **sure fire** way to lose weight, it is not the only factor. What you eat is also important, 
as they might have side effects that benefit or harm your diet.

*   **Eat low GI food:** GI relates to a food’s sugar content and how fast it releases glucose in the body. 
    For instance, certain grains like brown rice, wholemeal and oats have a lower **Glycemic Index (GI)**. 
    Thus **low GI** food will digest slower and cause you to feel full longer. 

*   **Avoid foods with high fat content:** fats are more **calorie dense** as compared to carbohydrates or protein. 
    1g of fats has more than double the amount of calories as in 1g of protein or carbohydrates

*   **Avoid sugars:** they are **“empty” calories**, or calories with no real nutritional benefit. 
    Sugars will cause you to unknowingly increase your caloric intake. Sugars can be found in many disguised forms, 
    including “healthy” breakfast cereals, flavoured yogurt and pasta sauces.

*   **Add more fruits and vegetables to your diet:** Fruits and vegetables are naturally low in calories and have a high water content, 
    allowing you to **feel full** without consuming much calories. Moreover, they help with digestion and overall health!

*   **Consume at least one source of protein per meal:** This can include a tub of greek yogurt, a cup of milk, or a fillet of fish. 
    Protein has been shown to **increase your metabolic rate** and stave off hunger longer.

## Sticking to a diet plan

Skipping meals can cause you to snack more often or binge-eat which can lead you to consume even more calories. 

A few tips to persevere through your diet is to have a **consistent meal time** everyday, and only **snack** on healthy snacks like nuts 
throughout the day if needed. You can also consume more **protein-rich food** such as which would help you to stay full longer. 
However, make sure to include it in your **daily calorie count** as the calories from snacks will add up.

Other good methods include **hiding junk food** around the house, to prevent **impulse eating**, 
and only having healthy snacks lying around. When eating out, you can consider scanning through the menu beforehand 
and **plan your meal in advance** to prevent overeating.

## The importance of exercise

Exercising helps to **increase the amount of calories burnt** each day. Moreover it also **strengthens** your heart and improves your circulation,

aerobic activity per week without increasing the number of calories you consume. Some examples of moderate-intensity aerobic activity are badminton, 
brisk walking and leisure cycling.
